This is the code behind [rssqueue.com](http://rssqueue.com) -- a service that
lets you create and curate RSS/podcast feeds that can be synced to tablets or
phones. This lets you create a “watch it later” list with content that is
automatically downloaded, even to iOS devices where one usually cannot simply
download e.g. a video file for later watching.

The code uses the [Yesod](http://www.yesodweb.com) framework. It is database
agnostic, but backed by an sqlite database by default.
